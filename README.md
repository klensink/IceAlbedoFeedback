# IceAlbedoFeedback

Volcanic eruptions eject ash and aerosol particles into the atmosphere that can cause temporary cooling, in the most extreme cases of more than 10 degrees over several years. The climate system is nonlinear, a brief, high intensity event can precipitate a rapid transition to a different state. This different state could be a fully glaciated planet or ‘snowball earth’, with obvious consequences to life on the surface. In this assignment we aim to observe how the steady state earth would respond to various volcanic scenarios and if rapid state changes occur. First we build a simple radiative energy balance model for our planet, dividing it into 6 latitude zones each exchanging energy with their neighbours. We then test several scenarios, including volcanic forcing, volcanic forcing with an ice-albedo feedback, and the effect of a supervolcano in different latitude zones. First we present the model and the assumptions included in it. We then reveal the outputs of the model in a results section. Finally we discuss the implications of these results and what further work could be undertaken to take this experiment further.
